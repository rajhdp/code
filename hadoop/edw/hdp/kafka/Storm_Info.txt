Storm Cluster ----------a. Storm cluster is similar to Hadoop Clusterb. MapReduce Program eventually finish as they are batch programs. MapReduce Programs are referred as Jobsc. on Storm you run Topologiesd. Topologies run forever as they are continually listening for messages.--> There are two types of nodes on Storm Cluster  - Master Node - Worker Node--> Master Node runs on a Daemon called Nimbus ( Similar to JobTracker on Hadoop)--> Nimbus is responsible for assigning jobs to worker nodes and monitoring failures--> Each Worker Node runs on a daemon called Supervisor ( Similar to Namenode on Hadoop)--> Supervisor Daemon listens and manages Worker Node--> To run a topology, there might be multiple worker nodes across the cluster doing a part of the job--> All Coordination between Nimbus and Worker is done by ZooKeeper--> (***) Nimbus and Supervisor nodes are Failfast and stateless....You can kill theese daemons and they will work normally --> (***) All the State is stored with the Zookeeper Storm -----> Storm is a sequence of Tuples from a Stream--> ( ???) Storm provides the (???) primitives for transforming a stream into a new stream in a distributed and reliable waySpouts-------->Spouts is a stream of tuples Bolts-------> Bolts can be user defined function to process spouts --> Bolts can lead to other Bolts as well
